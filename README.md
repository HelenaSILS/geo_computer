#Geo Distance

Geo Distance is a web app that uses Yandex API to calculate the
distance between an address given by the user and Moscow Ring Road
center. The result is displayed in the browser, showing both the
distance in degrees of longitude and latitude and in kilometers.

###Dependencies:
flask, requests, json, geopandas


###Usage
Once executed, the user should open the URL http://localhost:5000/
to see the results. In the same folder of the project, a new file
will be generated, the log.tx, which contains the address and the 
distance in degrees of latitude and longitude.
